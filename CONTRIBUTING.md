Contributing to DjToKey
=======================

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to DjToKey! :tada:

This project was started as a totally crazy prototype, but I felt it may be
kinda useful, and is pretty cool. At the moment, I am preparing 0.4 release
with a new look&feel. After this big release, I am going to consider DjToKey
"finished".

But, you are welcome to start contributing!

## Submitting issues
* You can create an issue here, but please include as many details as possible 
with your report, especially if you found a bug,
* Issues related to supporting new hardware should wait a bit, there will be a 
DjToKeyPackager application released as soon as possible after 0.4 release,
where you would be able to prepare your own definition files for any MIDI
hardware found,
* You can try to search if a similar issue has already been submitted.
